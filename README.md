# EmployeesFX
This is a Javafx study project.

When you run the application, you can open file with either .csv or .json files and get a list of employees, which you can select, for example, for one of your projects: programmers, testers, PM-s or analysts.
After you have formed your team, you can save your newly created list to csv or json file.
